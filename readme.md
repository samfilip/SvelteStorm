# Svelte Storm

A Svelte IDE like no other. Embrace the storm. 

Svelte is an open-source IDE with a built-in State Manager window for viewing your project in real-time, SvelteStorm will aid the rapidly growing Svelte community. With additional features like file directory access and a built-in terminal, its introduction to this community will soon prove invaluable. SvelteStorm was built using Svelte and Electron and is downloadable for Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems. We are hoping to provide a foundation to incorporate the tooling and backing that Svelte deserves. In providing this platform, we hope the community feels supported in their navigation of this framework as it continues to grow.
